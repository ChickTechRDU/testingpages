Zero Suit Samus is a Zone-Breaker type of character, able to pierce her opponents defenses with many camping tools and stuns that lead to a plethora of Setups. With a hit-and-run playstyle, she is a very fast character in both ground and air, able to poke and interrupt enemy approaches with her fast attacks, punishing any mistakes with a flurry of juggles.

Zero Suit Samus' ground game somewhat lacks range, but is packed with a lot of utility. Her Tilts are great for poking and initiating combos, while her Smash Attacks are very versatile. Forward Smash is a strong KO, Up Smash covers great vertical range, and Down Smash can stun opponents.

Her aerial game, on the other hand, is her greatest asset, with quick and strong moves that lead into many kill setups. Neutral Aerial covers a good range around her and inflicts enough hitstun for other follow ups. Forward Aerial is very fast for combos at any percentages, being a good starter at low percentages and strong enough to KO at high percentages offstage. Back Aerial is her strongest aerial, with high range and power. Up Aerial is her bread and butter for juggling, being excellent at setups for Boost Kick. Finally, her Down Aerial is a stall-than-fall move that can Meteor Smash opponents at the initial frames. She can also attack with her Grab Aerial, which is also a tether recovery tool.

To complement even further her moveset, Zero Suit Samus' Special Attacks add a lot of versatility to her arsenal, granting her decent camping tools. Paralyzer, her Neutral Special, covers decent range even when uncharged, and can stun opponents briefly, leaving them open for attacks. Plasma Whip, her Side Special, much like her grab aerial, is a great poking and spacing tool, as well being useful for tether recovery. Boost Kick, her Up Special, adds yet another recovery tool for Samus, as well being a very potent move very reliable for KO. Finally, Flip Jump, her Down Special is a both defensive and offensive maneuver, allowing Samus to gain a third jump for recovery, but also can be triggered again to cause Samus to kick her opponents, giving her a lot of unpredictability; if used correctly, this move it can Meteor Smash opponents.

All these attributes combined give Zero Suit Samus very reliable KO setups. With her stun through her Down Smash and Paralyzer, increased hitstun from Up Smash, Neutral Aerial, Grab Aerial and Plasma Whip, she can get extra time to hit opponents and score pinpointed strikes.

Zero Suit Samus' flaws, however, are very notable. Being tall and lightweight, she is an easy target and therefore very easy to KO. This combined with her natural fast falling and high gravity makes her very susceptible to vertical knockback. Also, she lacks a decent grab game, starting by her very slow grab, and with only her Down Throw being really reliable for combos; she also has no throws that can KO at decent percentages. This gives her a very poor neutral game, specially against more defensive oriented characters.

Overall, Zero Suit Samus' players must react quick to their surroundings, making full use of her stun abilities and quick punishing aerial game to pressure opponents, spacing well attacks to cover all possible weak spots.
