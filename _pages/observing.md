NGC 891 can be easily observed in several ways from a dark location that is relatively free of light pollution.

## Time of Year

Fall is the best time to view NGC 891. It is high in the sky well before midnight, and the weather hasn't turned completely cold.

## Binoculars

Using a decent pair of binoculars, with 50mm lenses, NGC 891 appears as a small but bright diagonal streak.

## Telescope

With a 5" refractor, you can easily see the elongated shape of the galaxy. From a dark location, you may be able to see the dark lane down the middle.

With an 18" reflector at 200x, the dark lane is very obvious and well-defined.
